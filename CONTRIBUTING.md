# Contributing to Design Driven Development

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Design Driven Development!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cybersoloss/DDD/issues) to report problems or suggest improvements
- For methodology questions or discussions, open a Discussion instead of an Issue
- Include examples when suggesting spec format changes

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b improve-loop-docs`)
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why

### What We're Looking For

- **Methodology improvements** — better workflows, patterns, or conventions
- **Template additions** — new architecture templates for different tech stacks (Django, Spring Boot, Go, etc.)
- **Documentation fixes** — typos, unclear explanations, missing examples
- **Node type proposals** — if you find a code pattern that doesn't map to existing node types, describe it with real-world examples
- **Translation** — guides in other languages

### Guidelines

- Keep the Usage Guide as the single reference — avoid duplicating information across documents
- Node type proposals should include: description, spec fields, sourceHandle values, and at least two real-world use cases
- Template contributions should follow the existing format in `templates/`
- Spec format changes require discussion first — open an issue before submitting a PR

### What's Out of Scope Here

- **Design Driven Development Tool** (desktop app) contributions go to [cybersoloss/ddd-tool](https://github.com/cybersoloss/ddd-tool)
- **Slash commands** contributions go to [cybersoloss/claude-commands](https://github.com/cybersoloss/claude-commands)
